Here are some other cool small features Amica comes with:

## Load/Save VRM Feature

Amica supports loading and saving customizable VRM avatars, allowing users to personalize their virtual assistant. Avatars can be loaded or saved for future use, with dynamic expression of emotions and lip-syncing in real-time.

## Load/Save Conversation Feature

Users can load and save chat conversations as `.txt` files. This feature is ideal for storing conversation histories, reviewing past discussions, or continuing from where a previous session left off.

## Wake Word Feature

Amica includes a wake word detection feature, allowing users to activate the assistant with a specific phrase. This enables hands-free operation and provides a more natural interaction with the system.

## Chat Mode Feature

In Chat Mode, Amica’s avatar minimizes into a corner of the screen, providing a compact interface. This feature is useful for multitasking, allowing users to interact with Amica while focusing on other tasks.

## Plugin System (Function Calling) Feature

Amica Life supports a customizable plugin system that allows users to add their own function calls. By placing scripts in the designated plugin folder, new functionalities can be seamlessly integrated, expanding Amica's capabilities.
