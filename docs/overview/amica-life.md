## Amica Life Features

Amica Life is designed to operate in a semi-autonomous mode, incorporating animations, sleep functionality, function calling, a subconscious subroutine, and self-prompting features to create a seamless virtual assistant experience.

### Key Features of Amica Life

* **Subconscious Subroutine**: Amica stores compressed conversation logs with timestamps, enabling it to remember past interactions and influence future responses. This enhances conversation continuity and provides a more personalized experience over time.

* **Random Animation Playback**: Amica supports customizable VRM (Virtual Reality Model) avatars. These avatars can randomly trigger animations, dynamically express emotions, sync with speech, and react in real-time, providing an immersive interface.

* **Function Calling**: Amica can autonomously retrieve  information based on contextual triggers within conversations. This is incorporated as a plugin system where new scripts can easily be written and integrated by developers.

* **Self-Prompting System**: Amica’s self-prompting system can independently generate follow-up questions or perform actions based on ongoing discussions. This makes conversations more interactive and allows the assistant to anticipate user needs.
